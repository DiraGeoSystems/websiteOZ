The Dira ProSuite Python Client is the Python API for the ProSuite Quality Verification Server. 
ProSuite is a suite of high-end productivity tools for ArcGIS for data production, quality assurance, and cartographic refinement.

The ProSuite Python Client is a lightweight package that provides access to the ProSuite QA functionality through a pythonic API.
Quality specifications containing QA tests for geodata can be fully defined in Python and executed on a ProSuite server which 
runs either locally or on a remote machine. Alternatively, an existing XML specification can be executed with just a few lines of code.

Find out more about ProSuite at `Dira GeoSystems <https://www.dirageosystems.ch>`__.

* Python Version >= 3.7
